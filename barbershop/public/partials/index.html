      <p>Wow! That was a sketchy climb...Cool view though! It looks like there's a river across the field. However, you're feeling a little hungry and you've got a snack in your bag.</p>
      <p>Do you want to go check out that RIVER, or EAT your snack now? Keep in mind you may be on this adventure for a while...</p>

      <p>...Someone's adventurous!</p>
      <p>After you made a proper walking stick, you wak around the boulder and start to hear sounds indicating there's a river nearby. Probably a couple miles to the east. Earlier, you also heard that there's also a cave only a mile to the west.</p>
      <p> Do you walk the extra mile (literally) EAST to the river, or walk WEST to the cave?</p>
